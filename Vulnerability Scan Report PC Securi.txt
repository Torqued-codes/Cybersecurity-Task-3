Vulnerability Scan Report: PC Security Assessment :

1] Introduction :

Purpose: Briefly state the goal ("To identify vulnerabilities on my PC using Nessus Essentials and document the findings to improve security").

Tools Used: "Nessus Essentials" 

2] Scan Configuration and Setup :

- Scanner Type: Basic Network Scan

- Target: IP address

3] Summary of Findings :

Total Vulnerabilities Detected: 24 (1 Medium, 1 Mixed, remainder Informational/Low)

Severity Distribution:

Medium: 1 (“SMB Signing not required”, CVSS 5.3)

Mixed: 1 (SSL Multiple Issues)

Info/Low: Remaining findings

4] Details of Key Vulnerabilities :

i] Medium Severity Vulnerability

Name: SMB Signing not required

Severity: Medium (CVSS 5.3)

Description: SMB signing is not enforced by default, which allows man-in-the-middle attacks on SMB connections.

Impact: Attackers may intercept or manipulate file-sharing traffic.

Remediation: Enable SMB signing on Windows using Group Policy Editor:

Go to gpedit.msc > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options

Set “Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications” to “Enabled”

ii] Mixed/Info Vulnerabilities

SSL (Multiple Issues): Various protocol/configuration weaknesses in SSL

SMB/HTTP/TLS/Windows (Multiple Issues): General information about running services, configurations, enumeration, and detected ports

Recommendation: Review configuration in future, but no immediate critical risk.

5] Conclusion and Recommendations :

The scan revealed no critical vulnerabilities and just one medium issue, which should be remediated by enabling SMB signing.
